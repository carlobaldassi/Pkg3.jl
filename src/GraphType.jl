# resolution process. We use one ResolveLogEntry per package, and record all events
# associated with that package. An event consists of two items: another
# entry representing another package's influence (or `nothing`) and
# a message for the log.
#
# Specialized functions called `log_event_[...]!` are used to store the
# various events. The events are also recorded in orded in a shared
# ResolveJournal, which is used to provide a plain chronological view.
#
# The `showlog` functions are used for display, and called to create messages
# in case of resolution errors.
